**Please double-check that your bug isn't user error or environment specific**
- [ ]  There were no errors when installing Whippet (or its dependent packages). 
- [ ]  `Pkg.test("Whippet")` runs cleanly.
- [ ]  I am using a GTF file (or also BAM) that is compatible with my genome build and sequence names (e.g. Ensembl vs. UCSC names)!
- [ ]  I didn't have any `Warnings` during index building, so my GTF file is in expected format.
- [ ]  If I was simply having trouble with input or output file formats, I would just ask a question in the [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/Whippet-jl/Lobby).
- [ ]  I still think I've found a bug...
